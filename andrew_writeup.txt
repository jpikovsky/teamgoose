Andrew Gramigna is a senior at the University of Massachusetts. Like Tim, he hopes to be an intramural soccer champion this fall. He made the sweet project logo using GIMP 2.8. He came up with the idea for getInSPIREd because of his own struggles with SPIRE and having trouble figuring out if he could graduate on time by adding a double major in Computer Science.
